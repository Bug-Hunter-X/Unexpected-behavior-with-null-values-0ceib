# Unexpected Behavior with Null Values

This repository demonstrates an example of a common JavaScript error related to the handling of null values. The function `foo` fails to explicitly handle cases where either `a` or `b` is null, which might lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures in the calling code.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function does not provide error handling or alternative logic for scenarios where `a` or `b` is null. This can cause the function to exit prematurely without returning any useful indication of the error or taking corrective action.  The behavior is non-intuitive and can be problematic when debugging and maintaining the code.

## Solution

The recommended fix is to implement explicit checks for null values and provide appropriate error handling.  This could involve throwing an exception, returning a default value, or logging an error message to provide better transparency and maintainability.

## How to Run the Code

To reproduce the error and see the solution in action, run the provided JavaScript files.
